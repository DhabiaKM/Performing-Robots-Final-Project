### Progress Report 1 

**14th of Nov 2022**

We started by building the base. We cut a piece of wood at the scene shop and sanded it down to make smooth edges. Before adding the motors, we also created openings for the wheels to fit in.

### Progress Report 2

**21st of Nov 2022**

We started building our robot! We found L shaped cardboard pieces around the lab and sawed them to a unifrom size. These pieces will form our robot's skeleton. Then using supports between each L shaped corner piece, we glued them onto the platform!
