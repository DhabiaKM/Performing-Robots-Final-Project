## Progress Reports <a name="ProgressReports"></a>
These progress reports are added as progress on the robot is being made. The goal is to make at least two entries ever week to show the development and document the building process.

### Progress Report 1 <a name="report1"></a>

**14th of Nov 2022**

We started by building the base. We cut a piece of wood at the scene shop and sanded it down to make smooth edges. Before adding the motors, we also created openings for the wheels to fit in.

The next step was to assemble the platform! Aaaand TADA!!

### Progress Report 2 <a name="report2"></a>

**21st of Nov 2022**

We started building our robot! We found L shaped cardboard pieces around the lab and sawed them to a uniform size. These pieces will form our robot's skeleton. Then using supports between each L shaped corner piece, we glued them onto the platform!

### Progress Report 3 <a name="report3"></a>

**27th of Nov 2022**

This week's progress was very slow and a little bit disappointing. We had a final project due during the weekend which meant we couldn't do much. We attached cardboard supports on each corner to be able to glue on the body.

We also found a big cardboard piece that we want to use for the body of the robot.

**Goals for This Upcoming Week**:
- Finish the Body
- Finish the servo motor connections
- Make sure all the new servo motor attachments work

### Progress Report 4 <a name="report4"></a>

**28th of November 2022**

Today we had to take off our supports and add more support to them, as we found out that there was no way for us to stabilize them using only hot glue. The Professor helped us bend the brackets back to shape. We drilled holes into the wooden platform and into the supports (after marking out spots, of course).

### Progress Report 5 <a name="report5"></media/a>

**29th of November 2022**

Big progress made today! 
- We drilled holes to place the battery with zip-ties on the platform. 
- We also secured the the supports even further with cardboard and hot glue from all 8 sides(2 side per support). 
- After this, we cut the correct length and width for the front and sides of our robot. Then we secured everything with hot glue.
- We also drilled into the servo arms that we're going to use.

**Goals to Work on Next**:
- Add cardboard brackets to secure the body cardboard piece to our supports.
- Add the servos and find the clothes for the robot.

### Progress Report 6 <a name="report6"></a>

**30th of November 2022**

For today, we finished and added quite a few things to the robot: 
- The Head.
- The Arms --> With supports inside the fist and arm parts
- Supports to the base.
- Shelf for the neo-pixel and the servos + any other mechanics we might need to be on top. This is also where the receiver(Ardiuno/NRF/MusicMaker) will rest.
- A door for the back of the robot.

### Progress Report 7 <a name="report7"></a>

**3rd of December 2022**
- Painted the arms and the head
- Attached the arms to the sides, but they seem a bit wobbly because they are heavy so they need more supports added.
- Coded the servos and made some arm movement

### Progress Report 8 <a name="report8"></a>
**4th of December 2022**
- Added the supports to the arm
- Coded the neo-pixel eyes --> Two modes: Neutral and Angry. We are planning out neo-pixel code on this sheets page: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10OB007oPhmtwvMAsuiGu0uw0XFK7GSwNcNFxZTwNpLo/edit#gid=0

### Progress Report 9 <a name="report9"></a>

**5th of December 2022**
- Worked on the radio transmitter/receiver scripts for the most part
  - Right now we are using buttons, but hopefully will transition to the switches soon
- We also went to the costume shop to find clothing for the robot


### Final Progress Report <a name="report10"></a>

**Finals Week and Turbulent Times** 

Here is a list of everything done to get to the final robot:
- Painted the head and arms -- We decided not to use cloth.
- Added white paper to the upper half of the body, and created collar, sleeves and a tie with cardboard.
- Added brown paper to the lower half of the body, and created shoes with cardboard.
- Coded the movement of the servo arms.
- Added the little flame pop up for anger's head.
- Fixed the neopixel library issue by just using lists to target specific neopixels.
- Coded the Transmitter/Receiver and integrated the control panel into the project (thank you professor!).
