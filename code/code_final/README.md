### Final Code

`receiver_v2` is the final iteration of receiver code used for the robot's expressions and gestures. As the name implies, it is based off of the first iteration of the `receiver` code, which can be found in my repository, or in `code_drafts`.

`transmitter_v2` is the final iteration of the sender code used to control the robot's expressions and gestures. As the name implies, it is based off of the first iteration of the `sender` code, which can be found in my repository, or in `code_drafts`.

`remote_control` contains the code that links a controller to the bottom motors of the robot to allow it to move. No adjustments aside from wheel weights (see code) were made from the inital code writing done when we were first introduced to the system.
